# ECE-250-Projects

ECE 250 is EE/CE &amp; SE's primary Algorithms and Data Structures course at the University of Waterloo.

Those looking at my implementations might be curious why class declarations and definitions are not seperated into appropriate header and cpp files respectively, as is the convention in C/C++, but instead are both in header files. This was becasue this was the template our teaching team forced on us (most likely so our code could be tested using their test drivers).
Projects

  Project 1: Implement the deque data structure using a circular array.
  
  Project 2: Design and implement a hash table which resolves collisions using double hashing.
  
  Project 3: Implement the quadtree data structure. 
  
  Project 4: Design a Weighted graph.


*Note: I do not allow anyone to use my implementations as thier own.
